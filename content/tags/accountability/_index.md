### **Accountability: Leadership Through Responsibility**  
Accountability is the **moral presence** to accept responsibility for your **actions and inactions**.  

If you make a mistake—**own it, learn from it, and do better**.  
True leaders embrace the adage **“The buck stops here.”**  
Demagogues, on the other hand, **pass the buck** and attempt to **shirk their responsibilities**.
